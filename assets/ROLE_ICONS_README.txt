Put the provided combined role image here:

  assets/source/roles-board.png

Then run:

  estrai-icone-ruoli.bat

The script extracts each role box (frame included) to:

  assets/roles/villager.png
  assets/roles/seer.png
  assets/roles/werewolf.png
  assets/roles/medium.png
  assets/roles/possessed.png
  assets/roles/bodyguard.png
  assets/roles/mason.png
  assets/roles/werehamster.png
  assets/roles/mythomaniac.png

When role files exist, the app auto-enables icons.
If missing, UI falls back to role-initial badges.
